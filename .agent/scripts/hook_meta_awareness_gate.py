hook_meta_awareness_gate.py — v3: Code-enforced domain-general interpreter gate.

Claude Code UserPromptSubmit hook. Fires on every user prompt. v2 matched
domain keywords (relational/social only); v3 classifies by ACT STRUCTURE so the
same gate covers trading, consumer, institutional, commercial, broadcast, and
relational reads without per-domain regex whack-a-mole.

Trigger classes (structural, domain-agnostic):
    T1 INBOUND-NARRATIVE   received story/act with stakes ("why did they…")
    T2 OUTBOUND-COMMIT     audience-facing act about to be (or just) emitted
    T3 THIRD-PARTY-VERDICT forming/broadcasting judgment of someone else's act
    T4 RESOURCE-COMMIT     novel money/time/reputation deployment (~S$100+)
    T5 FELT-EVIDENCE       feeling offered as evidence ("feels like the market…")

Why this exists (S545/S583/S601): `auto-invoke: true` frontmatter enforced
nothing (S534 anti-self-mythologizing). v2 closed that gap for relational cases
only; each new case class needed a new regex group (S583 added JUDGMENT). v3 is
the generalization: new domains extend the ARENA LIBRARY (substance-decode
Module 3, content), never this file (mechanism).

Epistemic status: code-enforced (harness runs it every prompt). KNOWN LIMITS:
      - Text-only: cannot fire on an act the user never narrates.
      - Claude Code only: hook-less environments revert to agent-discretion.
      - Regex tier is high-recall/low-precision by design; the injected kernel
        instructs the model tier to classify structurally on anything Λ >= 10
        the regex missed. Biased to over-fire (CS-125: false positive = one
        cheap reminder; false negative = a Hummer driven off the lot).
      - NEGATIVE guard: routine-ops prompts (reconciliation, test runs, doc
        chores) suppress a T4-only fire to keep fire-rate in the 10-30% band.

Contract: NEVER blocks (always exit 0), <50ms, stdlib only. Anything printed to
    stdout is injected into model context by the UserPromptSubmit hook.

META-AWARENESS GATE (hook v3, code-enforced) — fired: {classes}
Interpreter kernel — answer each question before responding (Prior -> Discriminators -> Payoff):
1. ARENA: What container is this, and what is its IMPLICIT contract (not the stated one)?
2. PRIOR: What is this arena's base rate? (substance-decode Module 3 library.)
3. DISCRIMINATORS: Which verifiable details move the prior? List them, or state "none — prior holds".
4. SIGN CHECK (MP-16): Is the working read inflating (self-flattering) or deflating (self-degrading)?
   Would I accept this read if the sign were flipped? Correct both with equal rigor.
5. RECEIVER FRAME (outbound, SimToM order): What does the receiver OBSERVE, intent stripped?
   What is their worst plausible SELF-referential decode ("what does this say about ME?")?
6. F != R: Is felt intensity being offered as evidence? It measures the feeler, not the world.
7. PAYOFF: What does each misread cost? Act on the asymmetry, not the point estimate.
8. AGENCY (anti-override): if ranking or advising, weight by the USER'S revealed preferences, not your model of what they should want — surface the weights, hand the choice back.
Guards: capital/position sizing -> trading-risk-gate owns the verdict. Keep the sincere read in the
payoff table — cynical-by-default is the same decode failure. Load substance-decode for depth.
