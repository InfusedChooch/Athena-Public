# 🧠 SKILL INDEX (Protocol Registry)

> **Purpose**: Master registry of all installed protocols.
> **Auto-generated**: via `generate_skill_index.py`

> [!NOTE]
> **Template Only**: This file shows the structure of a fully populated SKILL_INDEX. The protocols listed below are *not included* in the public repository — they are examples of the naming convention and organization pattern.
